# ism-cuda
CUDA implementation of concurrent batch-based independent set matching based on the auction algorithm.

The algorithm is adapted from [cbert](https://github.com/bkj/cbert).

This repo is used in the GPU-based VLSI detailed placer ABCDPlace, a part of [DREAMPlace](https://github.com/limbo018/DREAMPlace).
